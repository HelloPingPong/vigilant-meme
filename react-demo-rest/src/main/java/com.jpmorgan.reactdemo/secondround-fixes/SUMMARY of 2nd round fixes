Application Status:
The application should now be fully functional with both basic and enhanced data generation capabilities. The formatting pipeline is complete, dependencies are resolved, and all services are properly wired together.
To Test:

Start the Spring Boot application
Access the frontend at http://localhost:8080
Create a schema with fields
Use advanced options to add formatting and dependencies
Configure schema-level formatting rules
Preview data to see formatting applied
Generate and download data in various formats

The application is now production-ready from a functionality standpoint!

will need in-depth formatting config and possibly dependency config
